# Robotic-Arm
The project is aimed at moving the robotic arm by use of EMG signals acquired from the msucles
The components required are:
  - Unity for prototyping and path tracing of the robotic arm simulation
  - Visual Studio code
  - Microsoft Visual Studio
  - EMG sensor
  - 10k ohms, LM324 for filtering, 1 microFarad capacitor(3)
  - Breadboard for the configuration
  - Mechanical arm
